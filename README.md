### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a master student in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences/Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Previously working on COOSCA (ä¸€ç”Ÿä¸€èŠ¯/One chip per student) 2nd Gen. Currently I am working on the frontend (mainly branch predictor related stuffs) of XiangShan(é¦™å±±) processor.

During my free time I find it interesting to explore/contribute to some embedded/macOS related open source projects.

Feel free to contact me with chenguokai17ATmailsDOTucasDOTacDOTcn
