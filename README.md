### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior year undergraduate student in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Currently working on COOSCA (ä¸€ç”Ÿä¸€èŠ¯/One chip per student).

During my free time I find it interesting to explore/contribute to some embedded/macOS related open source projects.

Feel free to contact me with chenguokai17ATmailsDOTucasDOTacDOTcn
